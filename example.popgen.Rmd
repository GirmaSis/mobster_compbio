# Tumours 

~15 Popgen simulations with different parameter values for a branching process: Timon.

- Exploratory analysis
- Blind test (don't know which is neutral)


Top-10 PCWAG patients with: 

- only diploid SNVs (>300)
- purity > .8, median coverage >60x.
- VAF (corrected) > 0.08 (cutoff tail)
- patients ranked by purity * median coverage

>*Need to choose stats for performance analysis in Popgen, but seems evident that it will go very smooth. Real data looks way tougher than synthetic instead!*


### Overall feeling

**Popgen:** excellent, goes smooth.

**PCWAG:** seems to work, maybe can do better. We mistake some "clearly neutral" tumours. 

Boxplots of scores explain why:

- the best score is an outlier, wrt its class' median ICL value
- we take lower outliers (to minimize ICL);

>We could minimize the median score per configuration, or remove outliers. The fit would be more "robust" for the intiail "conditions", we might be in a larger basin of attraction for MLE/MM. Non-parametric bootstrap scores could be used to show this
