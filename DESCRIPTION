Description: MOBSTER is a package that implements a statistical model for tumour subclonal deconvolution
  which combines Dirichlet mixtures with distributions predicted by theoretical population genetics. The
  model implemented is a parametric (finite) mixture with multiple Beta components, and one Pareto power 
  law tail. Beta components capture mutations that rise up in frequency by positive selection, and the 
  Pareto tail models alleles resulting from neutral, intra-clone, evolutionary dynamics.
